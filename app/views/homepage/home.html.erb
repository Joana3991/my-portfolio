<div class="about">
  <p class="english"> Innovative thinker with a questioning mindset and strong interpersonal skills.
  I found in programming a way to pursue my passion for logic and problem solving, so I decided to change my career and became a developer.
  I'm looking for a job where I can have personal and professional growth, enhancing my programming skills and learning from great mentors.
  Equality and transparency are values that speak highly to me.
